Convolutional Neural Networks: Waste Segregation for Waste Management
This is a waste material classification system using Convolutional NeuralNetworks (CNNs) to automate the sorting of waste into distinct categories. 
This project applies deeplearning techniques to enhance recycling efficiency, reduce environmental pollution, and promotesustainable waste management practices. 


This will:

•Train and fine-tune a CNN model to classify waste such as cardboard, glass, paper, and plastic.

•Evaluate model accuracy using performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.

•Gain insights into the role of AI in sustainable environmental solutions


Use Cases:

•Smart Recycling Bins

•Automated Waste Sorting Facilities

•Waste Monitoring and ReportingDataset OverviewContextThe dataset consists of images of some common waste material categories. 


The images are classifiedinto seven categories, namely: Food Waste, Metal, Paper, Plastic, Other, Cardboard, and Glass.Content

•The dataset contains seven folders, one containing images of each category of waste.

•There are around 7000 raw images divided among the categories.


–The dataset consists of multiple folders, each representing a specific class, such as Cardboard,Food_Waste, and Metal.

–Within each folder, there are images of objects that belong to that category.  However,these items are not further subcategorised.

–For instance, the Food_Waste folder may contain images of items like coffee grounds,teabags, and fruit peels, without explicitly stating that they are actually coffee grounds orteabags.
